    i. First observe that for any given sequence that is in descending order, no next larger permutation is possible.
    ii. We need to find first pair of successive numbers a[i] and a[i-1], from the right which satisfy a[i]>a[i-1]
    iii. Now, no rearrangements to the right of a[i-1] can create permutation since subarray is in
    descending order. Thus we need to rearrange the numbers to the right of a[i-i] including itself
    iv.  we need to replace the number a[i-1]a[iâˆ’1] with the number which is just larger than itself among the numbers lying to its right section, say a[j].
